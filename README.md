# Text-Wrapper
A Console application that accepts a text file and splits the texts according to defined maximum length.

# Assumptions
*I have assumed that the text to wrap is read from a .txt file
*Secondly, the words to wrap are pure English language constructs
*The implementation is based on how word/line wrap happens in common editors like Notepad, Microsoft Word and TextEdit
